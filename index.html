            Hello Everyone! My name is Bert Keller and I am a 25 year old full stack bootcamp student enrolled at UCI.
        I am from Denver, Colorado but have lived in many different parts of the country. I obtained my undergraduate
        degree from Indiana University Bloomington, obtaining a bachelors degree in Informatics with a minor in Business.
        Following my time at IU, I lived in Austin, Texas for two years working for GM before coming out to California in 2018. 
        <br>
        <br>
            I enjoy many activities such as playing sports, video games, and generally anything that involves being outdoors.
        My favorite activities include playing golf, basketball, and skiing. I also really enjoy traveling. Some of my most favorite
        places i have travelled to include Europe(especially Austria), Morocco, and Hawaii. I look forward to learning more about 
        coding and web development in this class and taking my skills to 
        the next level.
